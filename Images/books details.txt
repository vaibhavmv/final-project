Before becoming an enormous film franchise, Jurassic Park was a very well received novel â€“ with a cover design that became as famous as the book itself, once it was carried over into the promotional material for the original 1993 film adaptation. Designed by graphic designer Chip Kidd, the high contrast Jurassic Park book cover art features a dinosaur skeleton, which remains as striking today as it did when Jurassic Park was published in 1990.
